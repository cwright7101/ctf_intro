Ghidra: open and analyze. Look at the strings. You will see wrong password. Go to that function and you will see the checking for the password in the decompiled code. You can optionally look at the CMP in the disassembly and decode to ascii.

GDB, set a breakpoint where it says Wrong password and then you can see on the stack what it is comparing to.


password is: 'SPaCIoSf'
