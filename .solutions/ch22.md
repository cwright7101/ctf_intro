Ghidra doesn't have a very good .NET decompiler unless you have some extra scripts. One way around this would be to use IDA with the .NET plugin or something like ikdasm.


On linux: 

ikdasm ch22.exe | less

This will dissassemble the binary and output to the less.

search for password (/password)

You can then see that there is some comparing going on and what the password is that it is comparing to.
